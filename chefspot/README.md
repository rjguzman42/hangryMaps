#  Hangry Maps

-> Sometimes we get hungry and have no idea what to eat. Let's fix that now. Hangry Maps is a food mapping tool that provides nearby suggestions based on user-submitted favorite meals and cuisines.

-> The app integrates Google Maps SDK & Google Places API with a custom map interface to provide a smooth UX.

-> All data is stored locally, which creates a seamless persistent state.

###### -> IN ORDER FOR THIS APP TO WORK, YOU MUST CREATE A GOOGLE PLACES API KEY AND INSERT IT IN THE CONSTANTS FILE (LINE 135)

## -> Enjoy! :)
